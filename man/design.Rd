\arguments{
\item{type}{The type of design. Supported design types are \code{crd}, \code{rcbd}, \code{lsd}, \code{split} and \verb{crossed:<type>} where \verb{<type>} is one of the previous types. See Details for more information.}

\item{treatments}{A vector containing the treatment names or labels.}

\item{reps}{The number of replicates. Not required for Latin Squared Designs.}

\item{nrows}{The number of rows in the design.}

\item{ncols}{The number of columns in the design.}

\item{brows}{For RCBD and Split Plot designs. The number of rows in a block.}

\item{bcols}{For RCBD and Split Plot designs. The number of columns in a block.}

\item{sub_treatments}{A vector of treatments for subplots in a split plot design.}

\item{rotation}{Rotate the text output as Treatments within the plot. Allows for easier reading of long treatment labels. Takes positive and negative values being number of degrees of rotation from horizontal.}

\item{size}{Increase or decrease the text size within the plot for treatment labels. Numeric with default value of 4.}

\item{margin}{Logical (default FALSE). Expand the plot to the edges of the plotting area i.e. remove white space between plot and axes.}

\item{save}{One of \code{FALSE} (default)/\code{"none"}, \code{TRUE}/\code{"both"}, \code{"plot"} or \code{"workbook"}. Specifies which output to save.}

\item{savename}{A filename for the design to be saved to. Default is the type of the design combined with "_design".}

\item{plottype}{The type of file to save the plot as. Usually one of \code{"pdf"}, \code{"png"}, or \code{"jpg"}. See \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}} for all possible options.}

\item{seed}{If \code{TRUE} (the default), return the seed used to generate the design. If a numeric value, use that value as the seed for the design.}

\item{quiet}{Logical (default FALSE). Return the objects without printing output.}

\item{fac.names}{Allows renaming of the \code{A} level of factorial designs (i.e. those using \code{\link[agricolae:design.ab]{agricolae::design.ab()}}) by passing (optionally named) vectors of new labels to be applied to the factors within a list. See examples and details for more information.}

\item{fac.sep}{The separator used by \code{fac.names}. Used to combine factorial design levels. If a vector of 2 levels is supplied, the first separates factor levels and label, and the second separates the different factors.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}} for saving the plot.}
}
\value{
A list containing a data frame with the complete design, a ggplot object with plot layout, the seed (if \code{return.seed = TRUE}), and the \code{satab} object, allowing repeat output of the \code{satab} table via \code{cat(output$satab)}.
}
\description{
Produces an experimental design with graph of design layout and skeletal ANOVA table
}
\details{
The designs currently supported by \code{type} are Completely Randomised designs (\code{crd}), Randomised Complete Block designs (\code{rcbd}), Latin Square Designs (\code{lsd}), Factorial with crossed structure (use \verb{crossed:<type>} where \verb{<type>} is one of the previous types e.g. \code{crossed:crd}) and Split Plot designs (\code{split}). Nested factorial designs are supported through manual setup, see Examples.

If \code{save = TRUE} (or \code{"both"}), both the plot and the workbook will be saved to the current working directory, with filename given by \code{savename}. If one of either \code{"plot"} or \code{"workbook"} is specified, only that output is saved. If \code{save = FALSE} (the default, or equivalently \code{"none"}), nothing will be output.

\code{fac.names} can be supplied to provide more intuitive names for factors and their levels in factorial designs. They should be specified in a list format, for example \code{fac.names = list(A_names = c("a", "b", "c"), B_names = c("x", "y", "z"))}. This will result a design output with a column named \code{A_names} with levels \verb{a, b, c} and another named \code{B_names} with levels \verb{x, y, z}. Only the first two elements of the list will be used.

\code{...} allows extra arguments to be passed to ggsave for output of the plot. The details of possible arguments can be found in  \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}}.
