The BiometryTraining package handles a number of common experimental designs, however sometimes things require a little more nuance. This vignette will demonstrate how to generate a more complex factorial experimental design.

We'll start by loading the BiometryTraining package:

```{r setup}
library(BiometryTraining)
```

# Factorial designs

Factorial designs are where there is more than one treatment factor that is applied to experimental units. They can be nested (where a subgroup of treatments from one factor all occur with a subset of treatments from another factor),
