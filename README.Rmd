The goal of BiometryTraining is to provide functions to aid in the Design and Analysis of Agronomic-style experiments through easy access to documentation and helper functions, especially while teaching these concepts.

## Installation

We previously recommended installing the package from GitHub, but it is now easier to use the Biometry Hub [drat repository](https://biometryhub.github.io/drat/). Use the following code to install this package:

```{r eval=F}
if(!require("drat")) install.packages("drat") 
drat::addRepo("biometryhub")
# Install as normal
install.packages("BiometryTraining")
```


### Troubleshooting Installation

- If you have the latest version already installed, you will get a response like:

<span style="color: red;">Skipping install of 'BiometryTraining' from a github remote, the SHA1 (e034b603) has not changed since last install.<br>
  Use `force = TRUE` to force installation</span>

- The following warning messages can usually be ignored:

<span style="color: red;">WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages, but is not currently installed.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Please download and install Rtools custom from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Warning messages:<br>
1: In untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir) :<br>
  skipping pax global extended headers<br>
2: In untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir) :<br>
  skipping pax global extended headers</span>

- If you receive an error that the package could not install because `rlang` or another package could not be upgraded, the easiest way to deal with this is to uninstall the package(s) that could not be updated (`remove.packages("rlang")`). Then reinstall with `install.packages("rlang")` and then try installing `BiometryTraining` again.

- If you are trying to install this on R version 3.5.x (or earlier), you should note three things:
  1. It *is* possible to install this package on R 3.5.x (and possibly earlier versions) as of 4 August 2020, but...
  1. You should upgrade to a newer version of R as soon as possible, as it is no longer tested.
  2. This package won't install properly until you have _downgraded_ a dependency that requires R 3.6+. To do that, use the following code:
  
```{r eval=F}
remotes::install_version("pbkrtest", version = "0.4-7")
devtools::install_github("biometryhub/BiometryTraining", upgrade = FALSE)
```


## Using the package

Load the package and start using it with:

```{r eval=F}
library(BiometryTraining)
```
