## Troubleshooting Installation

- If you have the latest version already installed, you will get a response like:

<span style="color: red;">Skipping install of 'BiometryTraining' from a github remote, the SHA1 (e034b603) has not changed since last install.<br>
  Use `force = TRUE` to force installation</span>

- The following warning messages can usually be ignored:

<span style="color: red;">WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages, but is not currently installed.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Please download and install Rtools custom from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Warning messages:<br>
1: In untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir) :<br>
  skipping pax global extended headers<br>
2: In untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir) :<br>
  skipping pax global extended headers</span>

- If you receive an error that the package could not install because `rlang` or another package could not be upgraded, the easiest way to deal with this is to uninstall the package(s) that could not be updated (`remove.packages("rlang")`). Then reinstall with `install.packages("rlang")` and then try installing `BiometryTraining` again.
